### Choosing your Locomotion style

as of version 1.0.0, Simia offers two types of locomotion!
- Gorilla Tag Locomotion/Gorilla Locomotion
- Capuchin v2-like locomotion

The Capuchin one has been known to give some issues, so it's not recommended.

Both styles have their own scene, so you can play with it if you want!
The scenes can by found in `Assets -> Resources -> Simia -> Scenes`

### What does Simia come with?
As of v1.0.0, Simia comes with working hit sounds, multiplayer (Which we'll go into detail on later), fully set up locomotion, some assets to get you started.

**MOST** of the things Simia has to offer are provided in Unity Packages. These are completely free and can be installed in literal seconds! You can find these in their own respective branch/sub-repository.

### How to install UnityPackages?

Unity packages are files created by Unity which hold certain Assets which can be moved easily around project-to-project with the click of a few buttons! Their file format is `.unitypackage`. They can be
imported via `Assets -> Import Package -> Custom package`. Each Package comes with it's own little menu showing how to use it, along with a written guide or a video tutorial.

### Multiplayer
Simia supports multiple multiplayer solutions, ranging from easy to set up solutions to ones that require a basic knowledge of networking. The following listed packages are the ones we support
- [Normcore](https://github.com/HyperSilver69/SimiaVR/blob/main/Normcore.md) (good for beginners, very limited.)
- [PhotonVR](https://github.com/HyperSilver69/SimiaVR/blob/main/PhotonVR.md)(Widely used, can find tutorials easily, not very secure.)
- [MirrorVR](x)Still in development, not yet available.


That brings us to the end of the basic setup tutorial! If you have any more questions, please ask them in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ME7UY9vYQD) and in order to set up multiplayer just select one of the highlighted solutions above!

See how the name corrolates to the actual word "Ceiling"? and a ceiling is above you, so we're going UP!
